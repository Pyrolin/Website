      <strong>Project Overview:</strong>  
      [Briefly describe what the Golf Bot is, its purpose, and the overall idea behind it.]
      The idea behind this project was to make an app that can search, filter and favorite cards from the card game "Magic the gathering".
    </p>

    <p class="p2">
      <strong>Goal:</strong>  
      [Explain the problem you wanted to solve or the objective of building this project.]
      The goal of this project is that it should make it easy for the user to be able to find the cards they want to play with or find and then favorite them, so that they can find them again later. The cards can be found by filtering for different attributes, so that the user can find exactly what they want to find. This should be done by using an API.
    </p>

    <p class="p2">
      <strong>My Role & Contributions:</strong>  
      [Describe what you personally worked on — coding, design, testing, hardware integration, etc.]
      Team management, coding of movement, computer vision.

    </p>

    <p class="p2">
      <strong>Technologies Used:</strong>  
      [List the programming languages, tools, and frameworks you used.]
      Python, Git, ev3-micropython 2.0.0.
    </p>

    <p class="p2">
      <strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong>  
      [Mention one or two significant technical challenges you faced and how you solved them.]
      Our computer vision initially had problems with differentiating the different objects on the course. This was solved by implementing a grid function, so that instead of looking on the field as a whole, the robot instead looks at all of the different grids, which gave it much more precise vision.
    </p>

    <p class="p2">
      <strong>Results:</strong>  
      [Explain what you achieved — e.g., working prototype, improved accuracy, efficiency, competition results, etc.]
      We ended up getting 5th place in the final competition, which is something we were very happy with.
