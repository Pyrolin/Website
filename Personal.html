<h1>About me</h1>

    <p class="p2">
      Hi, I’m a software engineering student who loves building things that are both useful and easy to use. I’ve worked with object-oriented programming, full-stack web development, machine learning, and even a bit of system administration — but what excites me most is solving problems and turning ideas into working solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      I pick up new technologies quickly and enjoy the challenge of figuring out how things work. Sometimes I’m deep in code on my own, other times I’m brainstorming with a team — either way, I like keeping things structured and focusing on creating something that actually makes a difference.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      Outside of my studies, I spend time experimenting with new frameworks, exploring emerging tech, and working on side projects that push me to learn more. My goal is simple: keep growing as a developer and contribute to projects that have a real impact.
    </p>
